        <p>A friend is someone who cares about you, supports you, and enjoys spending time with you. They're there for you through good times and bad, offering a listening ear, a shoulder to lean on, and sometimes even a good laugh. Friends are like family you choose for yourself, people you trust and feel comfortable being yourself around</p>

        <p>Memories with friends are like treasures we collect along life's journey. They're the spontaneous adventures, late-night conversations, and inside jokes that make us smile even years later. Whether it's road trips, movie nights, or simply hanging out together, these memories are woven into the fabric of our lives, reminding us of the special bonds we share. From shared triumphs to comforting each other during tough times, the memories with friends are the threads that strengthen our connections and make life sweeter</p>

        <p>This is a picture of me and my best friends. To Misha, Fatin, Fara, Adlina, Nazleen, Harris, Ameer, Mal, and Yusuf: throughout these 5 semesters, we've been friends since semester 1. I appreciate all the moments we shared together. From late-night study sessions to unforgettable adventures, each moment has been special. Thank you for the laughter, support, and memories. Here's to many more experiences and lasting friendships</p>
