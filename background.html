            <p>I was born on December 26, 2003, in Hospital Tuanku Fauziah, and I am now 21 years old. As the only daughter among five siblings, I have a unique place in my family. I enjoy listening to music, reading occasionally, and have a passion for photography. Currently, I am in my final year of my diploma program. Hereâ€™s a simple video that gives a glimpse into my life.</p>

            <p>I began my educational journey at Tadika Perpaduan Semarak and Tadika Bourgenvilla for kindergarten, followed by Sekolah Kebangsaan Beseri for primary school. Transitioning to secondary education, I specialized in accounting at SMK Tengku Suleiman. After graduating high school, I pursued a diploma at UiTM Kedah. Grateful for the privilege of education, I value the support of my family and mentors who have guided me along this path of learning and growth.</p>
<br>
<p>I gained a foundation in basic accounting during high school and expanded my skills at university. Currently, I'm focused on improving my programming abilities while also developing proficiency in editing, information management, and using software like Microsoft and Adobe suites. This diverse skill set reflects my commitment to continuous learning and readiness to contribute effectively in various contexts.</p>
